          Energy efficiency has become a business priority across the UAE, driven by rising utility costs and
          sustainability goals. For commercial buildings, effective facilities management plays a pivotal role in
          optimizing energy use while ensuring comfort and safety.
        </p>

        <h4 className="my-5 text-lg font-bold text-left md:text-xl">Understanding Energy Inefficiency</h4>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Most commercial buildings waste up to 30% of their energy due to outdated equipment, poor insulation, and
          unmanaged HVAC systems. The UAE’s hot climate amplifies this challenge, making energy optimization a financial
          and environmental necessity.
        </p>

        <h4 className="my-5 text-lg font-bold text-left md:text-xl">Core Strategies for Efficiency</h4>
        <p className="text-justify">
          1. Smart Energy Monitoring: FMFM installs IoT sensors to track real-time consumption and identify
          inefficiencies.
          <br />
          2. HVAC Optimization: Regular servicing, filter replacement, and system calibration improve cooling
          efficiency.
          <br />
          3. Lighting Retrofits: LED upgrades and motion sensors can reduce lighting costs by up to 40%.
          <br />
          4. Water and Waste Management: Efficient plumbing and recycling programs reduce total utility expenses.
        </p>

        <h4 className="my-5 text-lg font-bold text-left md:text-xl">Sustainability and ROI</h4>
